SMART was created by BenLand100 a very long time ago. It is currently hosted
on github at https://github.com/BenLand100/SMART and is mostly used by the
SRL community at http://villavu.com/ where it is a key component in their 
attempts to cheat at RuneScape. SMART (v5.0+) is released under the GPLv3 and 
has netted over 10 million launches over the past three years (v6.3+). For 
questions, suggestions, comments, etc., try one of the two links given earlier.

To Build SMART, use the instructions given in the Makefile by running `make`
in the root directory (the directory this file is in). Currently SMART has 
build targets for Linux and Windows and is mostly architecture independent.

SMART comes with some examples of use and various language bindings in the
test-apps folder, use `make test-*` targets in the to build the various apps.
Running `make` will give a list of test targets.

This smart build is designed to load the RSPS Alora.
Please run the official Alora installer first, so the
raw client is dropped into the correct directory on
your desktop
